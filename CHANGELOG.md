## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project scaffolding (kubebuilder), CI, OSS boilerplate, release automation, repo governance.
- `SignalPolicy` and `Finding` CRDs with real fields (deterministic slice only — no LLM yet).
  `Suppression` remains scaffolded, not yet implemented (a later slice).
- First signal provider: Trivy Operator `VulnerabilityReport` → `Finding`, gated by a
  `SignalPolicy` in the same namespace. Read-only RBAC on the external CRD; skips registering
  itself (rather than crashing the manager) if Trivy Operator isn't installed.
