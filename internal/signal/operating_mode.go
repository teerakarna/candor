// switch (docs/design.md:189, OperatingPolicy.Spec.Mode). policy may be nil (no OperatingPolicy
// exists) - that is not audit mode by this function's own definition: with no rate limit object
// either, CheckGlobalPullRequestBudget already denies everything on its own (see that function's
// doc comment for why that's a fail-closed default, not a numeric one). Keeping the two checks
// independent - "is there a policy to allow this at all" vs. "has a human explicitly paused it" -
// means each brake's own test proves its own claim, rather than one mechanism's test accidentally
// depending on the other's default.
