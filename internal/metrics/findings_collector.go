// findingsCurrentDesc describes candor_findings_current, the metric behind the dashboard's
// landing status tiles (docs/design.md interaction surfaces: "the dashboard is the proof
// surface"). Every other metric in this package is a transition counter (how many times
// something changed) or self-observability (LLM calls, budget) - neither answers the question a
// DevSecOps operator actually opens the dashboard for first: how many findings are open, right
// now, at each severity. A counter can't answer that correctly (verification transitions don't
// net out to a current count), so this is a live gauge instead, computed fresh on every scrape.

// write yet (VerificationOutcome == "") - possible only in the brief window between a Finding's
// creation and its first status write. Kept distinct from the real outcomes rather than silently
// dropped, so a scrape during that window doesn't undercount.

// FindingsCollector is a Prometheus collector (not a package-level metric var like the rest of
// this package) because "current count grouped by attributes" has to be computed from source
// truth at scrape time - the same reasoning kube-state-metrics is built on. Registered directly
// with controller-runtime's metrics.Registry in cmd/main.go, using the manager's own cached
// client - no extra List calls beyond what the cache already maintains from the controllers'
// own watches.

// with zero Findings simply doesn't appear, rather than reporting a bare 0 (Prometheus and
// Grafana's `sum(...)  or vector(0)` pattern handle an absent series the same way as an explicit
// zero for this dashboard's purposes).
//
// Best-effort on a List failure: an error here means this scrape has no data for this metric,
// not a crash - the next scrape interval tries again, matching every other best-effort pattern
// in this codebase (see internal/notify.Send's callers).
