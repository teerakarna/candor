// Package webhook is the generic signal receiver (issue #50): tools that don't expose a
// Kubernetes CRD the way Trivy Operator does (SonarQube, Falco, and most of docs/design.md's
// "Falco, Alertmanager, etc." list) can already POST an event on their own, so one receiver with
// one normalized envelope unlocks all of them without a bespoke provider each.
//
// This is the first mechanism in Candor that accepts inbound network input from outside the
// cluster's own RBAC boundary - CRD-watching is cluster-internal and already RBAC-gated, an HTTP
// endpoint is not. It never ships without authentication (issue #51, same PR): an unauthenticated
// receiver that can create Findings is a spoofing vector, not a lesser version of the feature.
//
// No +kubebuilder:rbac markers are added here on purpose - everything this package's Ingest call
// needs (SignalPolicy get/list/watch, Finding create/update/patch + status) is already granted by
// existing markers elsewhere. Secrets access stays deliberately ungranted at cluster scope, same
// as GitOpsRepo.SecretRef - a namespace enabling WebhookReceiver must also grant the controller's
// ServiceAccount a namespaced Role naming that one Secret.
